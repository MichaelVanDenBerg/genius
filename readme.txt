-- Front page setup.

This theme uses the featured content module and the portfolio custom content type of the Jetpack plugin
to setup the featured posts sections and the portfolio sections on the front page and the portfolio
page templates. Visit this page: http://jetpack.me/ to read more about Jetpack and how to install it.

After installing and activating the Jetpack plugin follow these steps:

1. Create a new page and select the front page template in Page Attributes section on the right.
2. Add a new post/page or modify an existing one and give this page a 'featured' tag and add a featured image.
3. Repeat step 2 for any additional featured posts.
4. Create a new portfolio item and make sure it has a featured image and a Project Type.
5. Repeat step 4 for any additional portfolio items.

The front page template will show both featured posts and portfolio items. The portfolio template will
only show the portfolio items. Additionally the maximum number of portfolio items to be shown on the
front page can be adjusted in the customizer while the maximum number of portfolio items to be shown
on the portfolio page can be adjusted under Settings > Writing (at the bottom).
